% - for two-authors publications:     AaaaBbbbYYYY
% - for three or more authors:        AaaaEtAlYYYY

%
%
% %% Convention for BibTeX fields
%
% Please, stick to the following formatting convention to easy maintainability:

%
% - order the BibTeX fields in alphabetic order
%
% - enclose all values within curly brakets '{...}'
%
% - do line breaks at 100 chars; this is ................................................. here -->|
%

%
% - put a colon ',' as well after the last field/value pair of an entry
