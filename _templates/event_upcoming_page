=== HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE ===
================================

Copy this file to `_events_upcoming/` and name it according to the naming convention of event pages as
described in the JLESC website wiki: https://github.com/JLESC/jlesc.github.io/wiki/Conventions

Then fill in the YAML front matter variables:

  title            (required)
                   full title of the event

  subtitle         (optional)
                   for events with 'page_type=event_page' (see below) this is optional, for event's
                   subpages ('page_type=event_subpage') (see below) this is required

  date             (required)
                   the date this page was created in the format: YYYY-MM-DD;
                   this will get displayed at the very bottom of the generated website

  updated          (optional)
                   in case you or somebody else came back later and edited significant parts of the
                   page, put in the date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) of that change;
                   if present, this will get displayed at the very bottom of the generated website

  event_location   (optional)
                   where the event will take place; try to be as short as possible,
                   "Building, City, Country" is sufficient here

  event_start      (optional)
                   the starting date of the event in the format: YYYY-MM-DD

  event_end        (optional)
                   the end date of the event in the format: YYYY-MM-DD

  event_url        (optional)
                   URL to an external homepage for the event

  event_short_url  (optional)
                   in case the above URL is very long and cryptic, you can give a short and readable
                   URL here only to be displayed;
                   this must not be an actual link

  wayback_url      (optional)
                   put here the URL to the snapshot of the event's URL as it is saved by the
                   WaybackMachine of Archive.org: https://archive.org/web/

  kind             (required)
                   the kind of event this is;
                   valid values are defined in _data/event_kinds.yml

  institute        (optional)
                   institute ID (see _data/institutes.yml) organizing and hosting the event

  permalink        (optional for main pages; require for sub-pages)
                   for the main page, this has to be left empty (or deleted); for event's sub-pages
                   this needs to match a certain pattern (see below)

  page_type        (required)
                   for the main page of an event (the default), this has field has to have the value
                   `event_page`; for subpages of an event this has to have the value `event_subpage`

=====================================
== Creating Sub Pages for an Event ==
=====================================
Each event can have multiple sub-pages.
These sub-pages are accessible via the tabbed sub-navigation just below the event's title on the
event's page.

To create a sub-page, do the following:

1. Create a folder in `_events_upcoming` with the exact same name as the Markdown file of the event
   (without the file extension).

2. Copy this template into the folder and give it a descriptive name and Markdown file extension
   (`.md`).

3. Copy all the YAML front matter from the event's main page to the sub-page.

3. Adjust YAML front matter fields for the sub-page:
   - `page_type` must be 'event_subpage'
   - `subtitle` must be given
   - `permalink` must be of the following form: /events/TITLE/SUBTITLE
     where `TITLE` and `SUBTITLE` are exactly as the file names without the dates, i.e. all lower case, dashes for
     whitespaces and no special characters

Example
-------
Given an event Markdown file `_events_upcoming/2015-12-24-jlesc-christmas.md`.
To create a sub-page for the Christmas presents, we create a folder
`_events_upcoming/2015-12-24-jlesc-christmas`, copy this template into that folder and rename it to
`presents.md`.
Then, in `_events_upcoming/2015-12-24-jlesc-christmas/presents.md`, we copy the YAML front matter
from `_events_upcoming/2015-12-24-jlesc-christmas.md` to replace the YAML front matter of
change the YAML fields `page_type` to 'event_subpage', `subtitle` to 'Presents' and `permalink` to
'/events/christmas/presents/'

Now, we have get a second tab on the 'Christmas' event page with the title 'Presents'.
